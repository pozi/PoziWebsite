For organisations that rely on geographic information for critical decision-making and stakeholder engagement, Pozi is a web platform that connects users with relevant location-based data to build a detailed and definitive view of their world.

Unlike traditional GIS software, Pozi is built from the ground up to integrate directly with live data from trusted sources to deliver powerful enquiry and analytical capabilities while avoiding duplication of data and effort.
