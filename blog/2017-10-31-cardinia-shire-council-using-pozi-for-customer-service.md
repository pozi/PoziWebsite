*Pozi's web map helps Cardinia's Shire Council's customers easily find local services*

Cardinia Shire Council contacted Pozi with a specific goal: To deliver a Geographic Information System (GIS) for their customers to access location based information.

They already had an internal GIS tool in place for staff, but this information was too complex for customers who needed simple data about their property and area delivered in an engaging and intuitive format. The Cardinia Shire Council IT department approached Pozi having seen their web based mapping system in action and wanted to implement a similar solution for their customers.

> “Our internal GIS is a complex tool to communicate to our customers. Implementing Pozi allows us to show crucial customer services online.” <br/><br/>
> *David Jackson, Manager of Information Services, Cardinia Shire Council*

> “Cardinia Shire provided more information for customers than many Councils. The GIS focus was not just about delivering lots of content, but helpful information for the growing number of young families moving in to the area.” <br/><br/>
> *Simon O’Keefe, Founder and Director of Pozi*

Cardinia Shire Council wanted to communicate helpful information they knew their new residents would be looking for. It needed to be shared as an easy and interactive format for the digital age. Cardinia Shire Council’s IT, website developers and communication teams all worked together with Pozi to implement a widget that seamlessly worked within their website to increase its functionality, customer user experience and deliver helpful, location-based information in a public facing system.

Once on the Cardinia Shire Council website, residents simply enter their property address to open an intuitive web map that details nearby child care centres, kindergartens, primary schools and secondary schools to their residence.

* If they’ve forgotten which bins to put out, residents head to the Pozi map and find their next bin and recycling collection date. Add hard waste to that too.
* Residents can also easily find their property and land parcel details, planning zones and overlays, plant zones all online.
* Come voting time, they can also quickly check their ward.
* Any issues? Councillor names and details are also detailed.

> “(Pozi) looks like it’s part of our website. Simon worked hard to make it work and to meet our needs.” <br/><br/>
> *Nathan Moore, IT Project Officer, Cardinia Shire Council*

*Since launching Pozi, Cardinia Shire Council has received positive feedback from their residents who rely on the information.*

An unexpected result is staff also find Pozi invaluable as part of their daily operations to guide customers to services, facilities and other information online.

> “It’s fantastic to hear residents are engaging with their property information and see it come to life in such a positive way. Residents are really passionate about their area’s details. We see great online traffic data and know visiting the website has become a key part of customer service interaction. The waste and recycling collection widget is one of the most popular pages on our website.” <br/><br/>
> *Peta Levett, Senior Digital Communications Officer, Cardinia Shire Council*

> “Simon is super flexible, highly responsive and really willing to help. He’s happy to talk about your customers’ needs and will work on ways to achieve these. We highly regard the working relationship with him.” <br/><br/>
> *Nathan Moore, IT Project Officer, Cardinia Shire Council*
