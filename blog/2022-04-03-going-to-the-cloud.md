# Going cloud should mean gaining control, not losing it

![](/static/img/pexels/pexels-gülizar-şener-160320-crop.jpg)

As developers of a cloud product, you'd think we'd be biased towards moving **everything** to the cloud. After all, Pozi is a cloud-native app that excels in the online world. It works seamlessly with web APIs to connect with live, trusted data sources across government agencies and other providers.

But we recognise that often your most important users and datasets and systems live and thrive on your **local network** (physical or virtual private cloud). That's why we developed Pozi's *hybrid cloud* architecture, to happily integrate with those critical local resources.

Without leaving the Pozi app, your local users have access to live trusted data from internal and external sources. It's the best of both worlds!

***So what does it mean for an organisation that relies heavily on local data integrations when one of its software vendors announces that everything will need to "move to the cloud"?***

***What's involved, and who benefits?***

### "Going cloud" can make sense if...

A move to the cloud makes sense when 

serving remote audiences who have no existing association with 

it enables greater integration with other cloud resources.

But 


### But why "go cloud" when...

**... your users are local**

**... the applications you integrate with are local**

**... your data is local**

**... your processes are local**

**... automations, database views, triggers, actions, scripts, software**

**... your collaborations are local**


### Evaluate the cost of "going cloud"

### Does the vendor have your interests at heart

* Does going cloud enable 

#### Legitimate reasons to go cloud

Ask your vendor if you'll gain any of the usual advantages of moving to the cloud

* will it be easier for other applications to integrate with it
* will it allow users to connect to live data

Or will the move be a step backwards

* does your organisation's data need to be duplicated in the cloud?
* will it limit the use of third party support providers?
* will it prevent database access for integrations or reporting?
* will it prevent the use of database triggers or views?
* will it enable your GIS to connect directly with data from external data providers?

Most importantly, **can trust that you'll get the support you need from the vendor?**

...we're developing Pozi's integration with QGIS to enable GIS Administrators to run Pozi as a fully-functional internal GIS, complete with integrations to live internal layers and databases.

At Pozi, we're enabling councils to leverage their existing infrastructure to gain greater control to integrate directly with council corporate spatial and non-spatial data.
