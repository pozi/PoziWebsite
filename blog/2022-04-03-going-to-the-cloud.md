# Going cloud should mean gaining control, not losing it

![](/static/img/pexels/pexels-gülizar-şener-160320-crop.jpg)

As developers of a cloud product, you'd think we'd be biased towards moving your organisation's corporate GIS data to the cloud. After all, Pozi is a cloud-native app that excels in the online world. It works seamlessly with web APIs to connect with live, trusted data sources across government agencies and other providers.

But we recognise that often your most important users and datasets and systems live and thrive in **local ecosystems** such as your organisation's local network or virtual private cloud. That's why we developed Pozi's *hybrid cloud* architecture, to happily integrate with those critical local resources.

Without leaving the Pozi app, your most critical users have access to live trusted data from internal and external sources. It's the best of both worlds!

***So what does it mean for an organisation that relies heavily on local data integrations when one of its software vendors announces that everything will need to "move to the cloud"?***

***What's involved, and who benefits?***

### "Going cloud" can make sense if...

* your audience consists only of remote users or external stakeholders
* it provides a cheaper alternative to an existing on-premise solution
* the solution enables greater integration with other cloud resources and applications

### But why "go cloud" when...

**... your users are local**

Your most critical users are the authorised users on your organisation's network or private cloud. They want fast, direct access to up-to-the-minute corporate data; not out-of-date copies.

**... the applications you integrate with are local**

**... your data is local**

**... your processes are local**

You've built a foundation of automations, views, triggers, actions, scripts and software integrations to suit the needs of your organisation.

**... your collaborations are local**


### Evaluate the cost of "going cloud"

### Does the vendor have your interests at heart

#### Legitimate reasons to go cloud

Ask your vendor if you'll gain any of the usual advantages of moving to the cloud

* will it be easier for other applications to integrate with it?
* will it allow users to connect to live data?

Or will the move be a step backwards

* does your organisation's on-premise corporate data need to be duplicated in the cloud?
* will it prevent your organisation using third party support providers?
* will it prevent database access for integrations or reporting?
* will it prevent the use of basic database functions such as triggers and views?
* will it make it harder for your GIS to connect directly with data from external data providers?

Most importantly, **can you trust that you'll get the support you need from the vendor?**

...we're developing Pozi's integration with QGIS to enable GIS Administrators to run Pozi as a fully-functional internal GIS, complete with integrations to live internal layers and databases.

At Pozi, we're enabling councils to leverage their existing infrastructure to gain greater control to integrate directly with council corporate spatial and non-spatial data.
