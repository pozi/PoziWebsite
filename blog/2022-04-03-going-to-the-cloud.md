# Going cloud should mean gaining control, not losing it

![](/static/img/pexels-gülizar-şener-160320-crop.jpg)

As a cloud-native app, Pozi excels in the online world. It works seamlessly with web APIs to connect with live, trusted data sources across government agencies and other providers.

And when your most important users and datasets and systems live and thrive on your **local network** (physical or private cloud), Pozi happily integrates with those local resources through its *hybrid cloud* architecture.

In short: without leaving the Pozi app, local users have access live trusted data from internal and external sources. It's the best of both worlds!

***So what does it mean for an organisation that relies heavily on local data integrations when one of its software vendors announces that everything will need to "move to the cloud"?***

***What's involved, and who benefits?***

A move to the cloud makes sense when 

serving remote audiences who have no existing association with 

it enables greater integration with other cloud resources.

But 


### Why "go cloud" when...

#### ... your users are local

#### ... the application integrations are local

#### ... your data is local

#### ... your processes are local

 automations, database views, triggers, actions, scripts, software

#### ... your collaborations are local



### W
* collaborations

### Evaluate the cost of "going cloud"

### Does the vendor have your interests at heart

* Does going cloud enable 

#### Legitimate reasons to go cloud

Ask your vendor if you'll gain any of the usual advantages of moving to the cloud

* will it be easier for other applications to integrate with it
* will it allow customers to connect to the most up-to-date data

Or will the move be a step backwards

* does your data have to be duplicated
* will it limit the use of third party support providers
* will it prevent database access for integrations or reporting
* will it prevent the use of database triggers or views
* will it ever enable your users to interactive with live data from external data providers

...we're developing Pozi's integration with QGIS to enable GIS Administrators to run Pozi as a fully-functional internal GIS, complete with integrations to live internal layers and databases.

At Pozi, we're enabling councils to leverage their existing infrastructure to gain greater control to integrate directly with council corporate spatial and non-spatial data.
