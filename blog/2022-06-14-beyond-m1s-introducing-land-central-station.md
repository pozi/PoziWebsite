# Beyond M1s - introducing Land Central Station

![](/static/img/undraw/undraw_sync_files_re_ws4c.svg){style="width:200px"}

We at Pozi have a vision to radically improve Victoria's property and address data maintenance processes.

It's an alternative to councils using **M1** spreadsheets for sharing their property information with the Victorian [Department of Environment, Land Water and Planning](https://delwp.vic.gov.au) (DELWP). It's designed to save time, reduce confusion, and achieve greater automation and data integrity for councils and DELWP.

Today we're announcing a new initiative, and we invite you to learn about it here:

### What's this about?

Victorian councils maintain the source of truth for much of the state's property information. DELWP relies on this information for its Vicmap Address and Property datasets.

However, the current data exchange process puts responsibility on councils to prepare and submit updates in accordance with DELWP's specifications and complex rules. Even with the help of automated processes (including our own [Pozi Connect](/pozi-connect/) software), councils report they are spending significant time and resources dealing with data preparation, validation and resolving ongoing discrepancies.

We have a plan to eliminate the friction between all councils and the Victorian state government when exchanging critical property information.
