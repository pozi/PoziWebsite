# On Metadata

I recently went came across an email I'd sent to a client from a couple of years ago in response to their enquiry about whether they should implement a metadata system for their GIS.

Here was my response:

> My general thoughts on metadata is that the demand for it is typically not driven by users, and anything that's not driven by users should be avoided.
>
> However, if there is genuine demand from your users for metadata, then I'd start with a simple spreadsheet on the council intranet, and put a link to the spreadsheet wherever users might expect to find it. I wouldn't implement anything more complicated than that unless you could prove that users were getting value out of that.

The client responded with a thank-you.

As far as I know, they have not yet implemented a metadata system.
