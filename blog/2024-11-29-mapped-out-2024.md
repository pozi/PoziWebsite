# Mapped Out 2024

![](/static/img/mapped-out-2024.jpg){style="width:400px"}

As the founder of Pozi, I've been coming to the [Mapped Out](https://reroc.com.au/mapped-out) conference for years to give NSW councils a glimpse of how Victorian councils are using Pozi Enterprise GIS platform.

This year I was happy to announce that we've now established a new partnership network to make Pozi available to councils across Australia. As a result of these new partnerships, we are excited to share we have already welcomed the NSW councils of Warren, Cobar, Kyogle, and Moree to the Pozi family, with more on the way.

With Pozi, these councils are now leveraging the power of QGIS, to enable GIS Administrators to control every aspect of their corporate GIS; from connecting to a variety of data sources, spatial and non-spatial, internal and external, in any format, to configuring simple or complex styles, setting filters, data joins, or dynamic expression-based fields and more. 

Users can easily search, visualise and enquire about features and locations across their LGA. Pozi also enables users to perform more advanced workflows with interactive tables views, dynamic spatial intersections, reports, measurements, annotations, and integrations with other corporate applications.
