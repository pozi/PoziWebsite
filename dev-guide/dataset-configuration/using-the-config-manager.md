# Using the Config Manager

## Ordering

Dataset ordering affects the order in which they appear in the Layer Panel as well as the order of results in the Info Panel.

To ensure that WMS GetFeatureInfo results appear at the top of the Info Panel, move all the Whats Here layers to the bottom, as well as other layers that don't have a layer group such as searches.

However the child datasets of the Property layer don't seem to respect the order in which they are specified in the config.

## Troubleshooting

==- The login page doesn't respond after entering credentials

Click the link for resetting the password. You might not need to actually reset the password, but clicking the link forces the page to respond. Return to the login page and try logging in again.
