Pozi Connect is configured to extract the information it needs from CSV files, extracted nightly from the TechOne cloud database.

Tables required for downloading to CSV:

```
nucAssociation
nucLand
nucLocation
nucProp_Location
nucProperty
nucStreet
```

Alternatively, the table names may be as follows:

```
P1PLN_LAND
P1PLN_PROP_LOCATION
P1PLN_PROPERTY
P1PLN_STREET
P1PLN_PROP_TRANSFER
P1PRC_ASSOCIATION
```

The Association table is likely to be quite large (possibly 100s of MBs). You may choose to apply a filter to it to reduce it down before downloading it.

```sql
SELECT key1,key2,association_type,date_ended
FROM nucAssociation
WHERE association_type = 'PropLand'
```
