# Pozi Connect

Pozi Connect is a powerful data extraction and processing application that extracts data from a range of spatial and non-spatial sources to generate derived datasets and map layers.

It generates map layers from corporate databases (spatial and non-spatial), performs spatial data analysis, converts between data formats (Esri SHP, MapInfo TAB, GeoPackage, KML, CSV, XLS/XLSX, GeoJSON and others), loads data into spatial databases (SQL Server, SQLite/Spatialite, PostGIS, Oracle Spatial), and generally automates many of the tasks that GIS Administrators find themselves doing on a regular basis.

## Use Cases

### M1

Pozi Connect M1 is a specialised workflow designed for Victorian municipalities. It uses Pozi Connect's powerful extraction and processing capabilities to generate reports of changes to councils' property and address information to feed into the Vicmap state map base.

Two-thirds of Victorian councils use Pozi Connect as a critical component in their property data maintenance workflow.

### PIQA

Each year, Victoria's Department of Environment, Land, Water & Planning (DELWP) requires councils to supply it with an extract of property and address information from their internal property systems to be used for DELWP's annual Property Information Quality Audit (PIQA).

The process of extracting, filtering and formatting this data is time consuming and often overwhelming for councils, and can require the participation and co-operation of council staff members across GIS, Rates and IT departments.

Pozi Connect enables over half of Victoria's councils to quickly and accurately compile their property and address information to submit for their annual Property Information Quality Audit (PIQA).
