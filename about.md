## Our Difference

We believe the future of GIS is about open data and open standards, with simple interfaces and real-time access to trusted data. It's about automated workflows and live integrations, whether that's in the cloud or on-premise.

We work with clients on their terms, in their preferred environment, with their preferred infrastructure and resources. Our open system avoids vendor lock-in by respecting our clients' autonomy and strategic technology decisions.

We embrace modern web technologies and continuous development and deployment processes to rapidly deliver innovative solutions that are driven by the needs of our clients.

## Our Story

<img src="/static/img/undraw/undraw_navigator_a479.svg" alt="" style="float:right;width:400px;margin:0px 40px;">

Pozi commenced as *Groundtruth*, a consulting company founded in 1999 to help Victorian councils better manage their Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

In 2009, we grew beyond expert advisory services and became a developer of geospatial software solutions. With a vision to "re-imagine GIS for the web", we launched Australia's first hosted web GIS, Pozi Web.

The release of Pozi Connect, a data processing tool, soon followed. This GIS product is now used by over two-thirds of Victorian councils and municipalities.

Over the years, we continued to develop the Pozi products in consultation with municipal clients to deliver improved features to better meet the growing needs of staff and their community. The work transformed Pozi Web to becoming a scalable and modern web app that enables organisations to integrate spatial visualisation, querying and analysis functionality across their corporate applications.

In 2019 we rebranded the company name to Pozi, with a fresh vision for ***building connected communities through spatial thinking***.

The Pozi team is committed to a future where GIS is synonymous with transparent data, open standards, user-friendly interfaces and real time access to authoritative data.

We are driven to enable more people to easily access and use spatial information to build the shared knowledge of their community.
