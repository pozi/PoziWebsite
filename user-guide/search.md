# Search

Open the search interface by clicking on the search button :icon-search: at the top left of the map or in the left panel.

The drop-down list displays any standard search options such as address search, as well as all searchable layers.

## Address Search

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: calc(48.979166666666664% + 44px); height: 0;"><iframe src="https://supademo.com/embed/P_THwHYYShrMT_1XJGTXz" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

## Layer Search

The search drop-down list shows all searchable layers. Pick from the list what you're searching for and start typing to view matching records from any field in the layer - ids, names, description or any other attribute.

If the layer is not already active, Pozi turns it on for you. When you select a result, the map zooms to the feature.

At any time, you can revert back to the default search by clicking ‘X’ next to the current search option.
