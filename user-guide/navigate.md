# Navigate

It's easy to navigate around Pozi using gestures and controls that are common to popular web map applications.

## Pan

Click and hold down the left-mouse button, and drag the map to your desired location.

## Zoom

### Incremental zooming

To zoom in and out within your map view:

* position your cursor in the map on the location of interest and use your mouse scroll wheel, or
* click the `+` and `-` buttons on right side of the map

### Fine-grained zoom control

If you want to zoom quickly to a feature instead of stepping through individual zoom levels, or if you want to fill a map precisely with an area of interest, use Shift-click zoom.

In the below example, we want to fill the map with a park for the purpose of printing a map, even though the area doesn't fit well with the standard zoom levels.

### Touch Device Features

On touch devices and laptop trackpads, use a pinch motion with two fingers to zoom the map.
