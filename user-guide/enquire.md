# Enquire

To discover information about any location on the map, click on the map or use the search tool to find your location.

The Pozi *Info Panel* displays Details about the location or selected feature.

## What's Here

When enquiring on a location via clicking on the map or doing a search, Pozi displays information from a variety of data sources that are relevant to the location. This enquiry mode is called *What's Here*.

### Simple Selection

Simple selections are triggered by any of the following events:

* a single click on the map
* using the Search function
* opening Pozi using a link that specifies a target location or feature id
  * example: https://westwimmera.pozi.com/#/search[propertynumber,1018753]/

### Multi Selection

In addition to enquiring on single locations, Pozi enables you to enquire on regions and multiple locations.

#### Regions

To enquire on a region:

1. click Tools > Select > Select by region
2. click on the map to start drawing
3. click on map locations to define the boundary of the enquiry region
4. double-click to finish

#### Paths

To enquire on a path (for example, to select all the properties along a pipeline or other linear feature), use the line selection tool.

1. click Tools > Select > Select by line
2. click on the map to start drawing
3. click on map locations to define the enquiry path
4. double-click to finish

## Feature Selection

Any map layers that are configured from a *vector* data source are directly interactive, allowing you to select individual features on the map to view its details.

When the cursor hovers over these features, the cursor changes to a pointing hand. Click to select the feature and view its attribute information in the Info Panel.

## Details and Related Information

Pozi displays information not only about features selected from the map, but also any related information from separate sources.

Pozi uses parent-child relationships between datasets to provide unlimited querying capabilities.
