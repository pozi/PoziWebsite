Pozi makes it simple to share or save custom map views.

Each time you interact with the map, the URL in the browser address bar is updated with information about the current state of the app. This URL can be copied and opened in any browser to recreate the current map.

The URL can contain any of the following information:

* map centre
* zoom level
* map layers
* visible panel
* *What's Here* target location
* selected feature
* layer name filter
