### Tender Response

If your organisation uses Expression of Interest (EOI), Request For Tender (RFT), or Request For Quote (RFQ) for software procurement, a premium will apply to the package cost and ongoing subscription. A minimum three-year commitment will also apply. Talk to us about what additional costs will apply for your procurement method.

Alternatively, you can avoid RFTs and RFQs altogether with a pay-as-you-go Pozi subscription. Minimise your organisation's commitment and pick a plan that keeps your expenditure below any procurement thresholds. There are no lock-in contracts with standard annual Pozi subscriptions.

[Contact us](./contact/) to learn how organisations like yours avoid months of wasted effort on RFTs and RFQs by switching to Pozi.
