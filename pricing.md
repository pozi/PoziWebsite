### Pozi Connect for M1s

<img src="/static/img/screenshots/pozi-connect-maroondah-m1.png" alt="" style="float:right;width:350px;margin:0px 40px;">

Pozi Connect generates property and address change reports (M1s) for Victorian municipalities. We customise Pozi Connect to integrate with your council's corporate property system, install it and provide training. The first twelve months support are included.

#### Reconfiguration

If your council is already using Pozi Connect, and you've switched to a new property system, we'll reconfigure your Pozi Connect to integrate with your new property system. Ask us for a quote.

### Tender Response

If your organisation uses Expression of Interest (EOI), Request For Tender (RFT), or Request For Quote (RFQ) for software procurement, a premium will apply to the package cost and ongoing subscription. A minimum three-year commitment will also apply. Talk to us about what additional costs will apply for your procurement method.

Alternatively, you can avoid RFTs and RFQs altogether with a pay-as-you-go Pozi subscription. Minimise your organisation's commitment and pick a plan that keeps your expenditure below any procurement thresholds. There are no lock-in contracts with standard annual Pozi subscriptions.

[Contact us](./contact/) to learn how organisations like yours avoid months of wasted effort on RFTs and RFQs by switching to a cost-effective Pozi subscription.
