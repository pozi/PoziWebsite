### Tender Response

If your organisation uses Request For Tender (RFT) or Request For Quote (RFQ) for software procurement, a premium will apply to the package cost and ongoing subscription. Talk to us about what additional costs will apply for your procurement method.

Alternatively, you can avoid RFTs and RFQs altogether with an annual Pozi subscription to keep your organisation's commitments below any procurement thresholds. There are no lock-in contracts with Pozi.

[Contact us](./contact/) to learn how organisations like yours avoid months of wasted effort on RFTs and RFQs by switching to Pozi.
