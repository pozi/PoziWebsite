# How Pozi Works

Pozi is a web application that aggregates spatial and non-spatial data from various public and private sources.

The hybrid cloud architecture of the Pozi platform connects users directly to live, authoritative data sources to maintain information integrity and eliminate data double-handling.

**Organisations** gain efficiencies from not having to import, process, store and republish data from internal and external sources.

**Users** gain confidence that they have easy, direct access to the critical information they need.
