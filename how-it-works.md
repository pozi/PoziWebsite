# How Pozi Works

Pozi is a web application that aggregates spatial and non-spatial data from various public and private sources.

Pozi's *hybrid cloud* architecture connects users directly to live, authoritative data sources to maintain information integrity and eliminate data double-handling.

## Architecture

+++ Public and Pro

Public users can easily access publicly available data.

+++ Enterprise

Users who are connected to the corporate network (either physically or via VPN) have access to internal data sources.

+++ Enterprise Cloud

Users who are signed in to their Microsoft account gain access to corporate data sources that are made available through Microsoft App Proxy.

## Benefits

**Organisations** gain efficiencies from not having to import, process, store and republish data from internal and external sources.

**Users** gain confidence that they have easy, direct access to the critical information they need.
