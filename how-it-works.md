# How Pozi Works

Pozi is a web application that aggregates spatial and non-spatial data from various public and private sources.

Pozi's *hybrid cloud* architecture connects users directly to live, authoritative data sources to maintain information integrity and eliminate data double-handling.

## Architecture

â€‹Pozi utilises many data APIs, most of which are public data catalogues made available by government and commercial providers.

In addition, Pozi *Enterprise Cloud* sites have QGIS Server installed on their network which acts as an API for the organisation's internal datasets. The internal datasets are authorised via Microsoft App Proxy.

Users who are signed in to their Microsoft account gain access to corporate data sources through Microsoft App Proxy.

+++ Public

Public users can easily access publicly available data.

## Benefits

**Organisations** gain efficiencies from not having to import, process, store and republish data from internal and external sources.

**Users** gain confidence that they have easy, direct access to the critical information they need.
