# How Pozi Works

Pozi is a web application that aggregates spatial and non-spatial data from various public and private sources.

Pozi's *hybrid cloud* architecture connects users directly to live, authoritative data sources to maintain information integrity and eliminate data double-handling.

## Architecture

â€‹Pozi utilises many data APIs, most of which are public data catalogues made available by government and commercial providers.

In addition, Pozi *Enterprise* and *Enterprise Cloud* sites have Pozi Server installed on their network which acts as an API for the an organisation's internal datasets. The internal datasets are available only to users within the network (*Enterprise*), or authorised via Microsoft App Proxy (*Enterprise Cloud*).
