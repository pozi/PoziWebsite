# How Pozi Works

Pozi is a web application that aggregates spatial and non-spatial data from various public and private sources.

The hybrid cloud architecture of the Pozi platform connects users directly to live, authoritative data sources to maintain information integrity and eliminate data double-handling.

## Architecture

+++ Public and Pro

Public users can easily access publicly available data.

+++ Enterprise

Users who are connected to the corporate network (either physically or via VPN) have access to internal data sources.

+++ Enterprise Cloud

Users who are signed in to their Microsoft account gain access to corporate data sources that are made available through Microsoft App Proxy.
