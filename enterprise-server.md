<big>API for your organisation's spatial and non-spatial data</big>

Turn any internal data source into a data endpoint for use in Pozi Web and other corporate applications on your network.

Enterprise Server is a key component of *Pozi Enterprise Edition*. It enables internal staff to view corporate data within Pozi Web map application.

The open API also enables other non-GIS applications to access datasets on demand. Enterprise Server can pre-populate web forms with data from spatial and non-spatial sources, compile mail merge lists based on property ids, generate reports for external parties, and more.

Enterprise Server uses your network's group policies to maintain permission levels for users and applications.
