# Publishing With QGIS

*Available for Pozi Enterprise and Enterprise Cloud customers*

[QGIS](https://qgis.org/) is a popular open source desktop GIS application with advanced layer configuration capabilities.

*Pozi Enterprise* and *Enterprise Cloud* enables administrators to use QGIS to compile and configure internal datasets and publish local datasets to local Pozi users.

Any layers configured in a dedicated QGIS project are served by QGIS Server, which is installed on the client network or private cloud. QGIS Server is a standards-based WMS/WFS server, with similar performance as MapServer and GeoServer, but with the ability to use QGIS desktop for layer configuration.

The layers within any QGIS project are appear in a layer group in the Pozi layer panel.
