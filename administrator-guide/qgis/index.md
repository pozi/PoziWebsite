# Publishing With QGIS

*Available for Pozi Enterprise and Enterprise Cloud customers*

[QGIS](https://qgis.org/) is a popular open source desktop GIS application with advanced layer configuration capabilities.

*Pozi Enterprise* and *Enterprise Cloud* enables administrators to use QGIS to compile and configure internal datasets and publish them to local Pozi users.

Any layers configured in dedicated QGIS projects are served by QGIS Server, which is installed on the client network or private cloud. QGIS Server is a standards-based WMS/WFS server, with similar performance as MapServer and GeoServer, but with the ability to use QGIS desktop for layer configuration.

The layers within any QGIS project are appear in a layer group in the Pozi layer panel.
