# Setting Up QGIS

These are the recommended settings for QGIS. They are optional. They only need to be set once.

## Project Settings

QGIS > Settings > Options > General > Project Files >

* Prompt for confirmation when a layer is to be removed: untick
* Default project file format: QGS Project

## Styling Panel

QGIS > View > Panels > Layer Styling

## Quick Access for Layer Files

Add the UNC path of your GIS data folder as a *Favorite* in the QGIS Browser panel for easy access. Learn more [here](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/browser.html#favorites). Also add a shortcut to the UNC location on your PC desktop for extra convenience.
