If you don't have credentials to log in to IWS, contact coordinated.imagery@delwp.vic.gov.au. New clients for Pozi will also need to pass any new credentials on to support@pozi.com so that Pozi can be configured to access to the layers. (Client credentials will remain private within Pozi's web proxy service).
