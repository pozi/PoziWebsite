# Publisher

Pozi Publisher standardises a wide range of spatial information from inside and outside your organisation into easily digestible ***map catalogues*** that integrate seamlessly into Pozi Web GIS.

Features:

- generate map catalogues from a wide variety of internal and external spatial data sources
- dynamically customise catalogues to suit your organisation's specific requirements
- bulk extract map data from catalogues for direct consumption
- sync map layers from internal catalogues to the cloud
- build search indexes across map layers (coming soon)

## Functions

- catalogue generator
  - generate production-ready OGC-compliant map catalogues from QGIS projects
  - save local versions of catalogues from external providers
- catalogue processor
  - search and replace text
  - filter layers
  - embed custom metadata
- layer generator
  - export GeoJSON and SLD files for all layers in a catalogue
- data distributor
  - sync data generated from local sources up to S3
- search index generator
  - compile index of features and attributes for fast searching
- version control of QGIS projects

## Use Cases

- improve load times in web map applications by pre-generating catalogues from internal and external web map servers into static XML files
- generate custom catalogues from external web servers
- publish layers to the public from QGIS projects 
- bulk download map data from external catalogues on a routine schedule
- fine-tune control of layer behaviour in Pozi Web GIS by augmenting map catalogues with custom metadata
- automatically populate the appropriate 'Advertised URL' settings for any catalogues coming from QGIS projects
- use QGIS to create or organise custom layer catalogues that point to external web services

## How it works

Pozi Publisher processes public and private datasets into easily digestible ***map catalogues*** that integrate seamlessly into Pozi Web GIS.

A map catalogue is a collection of map layers, typically in XML format generated by a WFS `GetCapabilities` or QGIS `GetProjectSettings`.

The catalogue is the unit around which the Pozi Publisher workflow is based, either generating catalogues from various sources, modifying catalogues for specific use cases, or extracting information from catalogues.
