# Frequently Asked Questions

## User Experience

==- Does Pozi have a mobile app?

Pozi is a web application that runs in any desktop or mobile browser.

Pozi's responsive design enables it to work on any sized device. On large screens, it displays in landscape mode. On smaller screens such as phones, it displays in portrait mode, with the menu displaying under the map.

Pozi uses Progressive Web App (PWA) technology, enabling users to add Pozi to the home screen of their device, launch it and switch between it and other apps as if it were a native application.

==- Is it possible to limit what attributes are shown?

You can configure what fields your users see by using the layer configuration options in QGIS. You can even modify the field names that your users see, as well as create virtual fields to display values derived or calculated from existing fields. This can all be done without modifying your data or setting up views in SQL Server.

## Platform

==- How does the Pozi platform deal with scalability and security?

Pozi's cloud architecture ensures fast performance, maximum stability, and unlimited scalability.

Pozi is fully hosted and managed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), served from an Australian-based data centre. The application is deployed to AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) and served by AWS CloudFront.

Pozi is fully compliant with https to ensure user privacy and compatibility with all major browsers.
Pozi App is encrypted and authenticated using TLS 1.2/1.3, X25519, and AES_128_GCM.

As a serverless web application, Pozi is not vulnerable to server exploits. AWS Cloudfront provides protection from DDOS attacks.

We monitor the uptime of the Pozi application using Pingdom. Pozi maintained a 99.999% uptime over the last three years.

==- How does Pozi deal with updates and bug fixes?

We embrace continuous development and deployment processes to ensure our clients have access to the latest version. Updated releases which include bug fixes, enhancements and new features are deployed several times per month. Any critical fixes can be deployed in a matter of hours.

## Packages

==- How does Pozi *Enterprise Cloud* differ from Pozi *Enterprise*?

The Enterprise Cloud package enables you to maintain and manage your organisation's data within its existing IT infrastructure while allowing authorised users to access internal data via their Microsoft account.

Enterprise and Enterprise Cloud packages both integrate with your on-premise data. However Enterprise Cloud enables staff to view internal data without needing to be connected to the corporate network. It also gives you greater control over which users can access which data.
