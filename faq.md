# Frequently Asked Questions

==- Can Pozi Enterprise provide access to external parties for internal datasets?

Pozi's hybrid cloud architecture enables organisations to control access via network permissions. Any user who is granted access to the organisation's network or VPN will obtain access to the internal data sources in Pozi.

Users who are not on the network will have no way of gaining access to internal datasets.

We are exploring solutions for enabling this kind of access for external parties in the future. Stay posted, or [contact us](./contact/) for more details.
