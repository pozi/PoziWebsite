### Benefit from a hosted web map that...

✔️ Displays location-based information and data from multiple sources in one map window<br/>
✔️ Creates maps for enquiries, visualisation and fieldwork<br/>
✔️ Integrates existing systems and software easily at lower cost<br/>
✔️ Customises to your unique data<br/>
✔️ Eliminates expensive software licensing fees and doesn't lock you in to a long-term contract<br/>

<br/>

### Pozi features...

Deliver data to staff and public – easily and affordably. Users can access the information they need at any time, such as property information, nearby community facilities and services, and aerial imagery.

✔️ **Manage services intelligently** - Staff can view additional information such as property owner details and asset information<br/>
✔️ **Find information about any location** - View land parcel details, planning controls, road closures, maintenance schedules, major projects, waste collection zones and more<br/>
✔️ **Reduce data maintenance overheads** - the Pozi app operates independently of your internal IT infrastructure and connects live to state and federal government web services so you don't have to spend time maintaining and updating background datasets<br/>

<br/>

✔️ Responsive design for desktop, tablet and mobile devices<br/>
✔️ Bookmarking of locations, layers and features for sending links and embedding custom maps in your website<br/>
✔️ Integration with internal and external sources to display vital information for any location<br/>
