### Pozi features...

Deliver data to staff and public – easily and affordably. Users can access the information they need at any time, such as property information, nearby community facilities and services, and aerial imagery.

* ✔️ **Manage services intelligently** - Staff can view additional information such as property owner details and asset information
* ✔️ **Find information about any location** - View land parcel details, planning controls, road closures, maintenance schedules, major projects, waste collection zones and more.
* ✔️ **Reduce data maintenance overheads** - the Pozi app operates independently of your internal IT infrastructure and connects live to state and federal government web services so you don't have to spend time maintaining and updating background datasets
