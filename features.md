## Pozi Public

### Authoritative, responsive & well supported

||| :icon-zap: <h4>Live, authoritative data</h4>
Pozi connects to GIS data at its source to deliver your online map with the most accurate, up-to-date information possible; also eliminating the hassle of maintaining local copies of external datasets.
||| :icon-people: <h4>Customer support</h4>
Receive personalised assistance by phone or email from the Pozi team in Melbourne, Australia -- the people who administer and develop the Pozi platform.
||| :icon-versions: <h4>Responsive design</h4>
Pozi maps are fully responsive to fit on any device. Whether your customers are searching information on a desktop, tablet or phone, Pozi intelligently arranges its interface to make best use of the available screen size.
|||

<br/>
<br/>

### Intelligent with pinpoint GPS accuracy

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

||| :icon-search: <h4>Intelligent address search</h4>
Pozi's autocomplete address search rapidly returns results specific to an address and the map's region. The Pozi search box intelligently parses customers' requests to get to an address with a minimum of keystrokes and fuss.
||| :icon-location: <h4>GPS location</h4>
Users easily centre the map by pressing the GPS button, and Pozi uses their device's GPS to pinpoint their location on the map.
||| :icon-globe: <h4>Aerial imagery</h4>
Aerial imagery allows users to clearly see the visual landmarks of their location including buildings, roads and vegetation. With a single click, customers can toggle on or off an aerial photo layer.
|||

<br/>

### Unlimited users, zero install & custom maps

||| :icon-key: <h4>Zero installation</h4>
Users don't need to install any specialty software to use Pozi. The online map is accessible on any device.

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

||| :icon-comment-discussion: <h4>Community engagement</h4>
Pozi Pro is your two-way communications channel with integrated forms enabling your community to provide feedback, fill in surveys, book facilities, post events, or report issues about user-selected locations.
||| :icon-search: <h4>Advanced search</h4>
With Pozi Pro, users can search for a location using information other than an address, such as a facility name, property id, asset id and more.
||| :icon-location: <h4>Nearby places</h4>
Whenever a user searches for their address or location, Pozi Pro shows the nearest facilities and services to that address, helping users quickly get their bearings.
|||

<br/>

### Multiple imagery layers, plus widgets

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

||| :icon-stack: <h4>Multiple imagery layers</h4>
Enable users to pick between multiple images to compare by date for monitoring urban growth, building footprints, vegetation and more. Pozi Pro can also merge imagery from multiple captures into a seamless layer for complete coverage.
||| :icon-paper-airplane: <h4>Map widget</h4>
Pozi Pro's map widget allows you to embed an address search box on your website to launch a custom map. Users simply enter an address and Pozi Pro will launch its map featuring their chosen location.
||| :icon-code-square: <h4>Data widget</h4>
The data widget is an address search box embedded on your website that directly displays location-specific information (without a map launch), such as council bin collection dates.
|||

<br/>

### Filtering, GPS tracking and bookmarks

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

||| :icon-sort-desc: <h4>Layer filter & mulit-select</h4>
Layer filtering allows users to pick the subset of visual data and detail specifically what you would like viewable on a map. Users can select multiple properties in Pozi Pro by defining areas of interest.
||| :icon-milestone: <h4>GPS tracking</h4>
Pozi Pro has optional constant GPS tracking that follows users as they walk or drive, allowing easy identification of assets and other roadside features as they travel.
||| :icon-bookmark: <h4>Custom bookmarking</h4>
Pozi Pro can generate custom map links to control exactly how the app appears to users. Focus your users' attention on what you want them to see, hiding unneeded datasets and buttons. Especially helpful for customer service and emailing map information specific to the customer.
