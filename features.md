## Pozi Public

### Authoritative, responsive & well supported

||| :icon-zap: <h4>Live, authoritative data</h4>

<br/>

### Intelligent with pinpoint GPS accuracy

||| :icon-search: <h4>Intelligent address search</h4>
Pozi's autocomplete address search rapidly returns results specific to an address and the map’s region. The Pozi search box intelligently parses customers’ requests to get to an address with a minimum of keystrokes and fuss.
||| :icon-location: <h4>GPS location</h4>
Pozi maps incorporates GPS to help customers out-and-about find their current location in relation to other data. Customers easily centre the map by using ‘locate function’ and Pozi uses their device’s GPS to pinpoint their location on the map.
||| :icon-globe: <h4>Aerial imagery</h4>
Aerial imagery allows users to clearly see the visual landmarks of their location including buildings, roads and vegetation. With a single click, customers can toggle on or off an aerial photo layer.
|||

<br/>

### Unlimited users, zero install & custom maps

||| :icon-people: <h4>Unlimited users</h4>
Want to share your organisation’s data with a wider audience? Pozi scales to serve any number of users. The team at Pozi will take care of your website infrastructure, so you can concentrate on your business.
||| :icon-key: <h4>Zero installation</h4>
Users don’t need to install any specialty software to use Pozi. The online map is accessible on any device.
||| :icon-copy: <h4>Custom maps</h4>
Pozi allows you to have unlimited, embeddable and bookmarkable maps customised to your organisation’s data.
|||

## Pozi Pro

Pozi Pro offers your organisation all the above features along with more advanced functionality to further engage with customers and satisfy the demands of internal staff and other repeat users.

||| :icon-comment-discussion: <h4>Community engagement</h4>
Pozi Pro is your two-way communications channel with integrated forms enabling your community to provide feedback, fill in surveys, book facilities, post events, or report issues about user-selected locations.
||| :icon-search: <h4>Advanced search</h4>
With Pozi Pro, users can search for a location using information other than an address, such as a facility name, property id, asset id and more.
||| :icon-location: <h4>Nearby places</h4>
Whenever a user searches for their address or location, Pozi Pro shows the nearest facilities and services to that address, helping users quickly get their bearings.
|||

<br/>

### Multiple layers & widgets

||| :icon-stack: <h4>Multiple imagery layers</h4>
Features such as combining multiple images, toggling aerial images by date, comparing date-stamped visible & infra-red images for urban growth data, building footprints, vegetation and more. Pozi Pro can also merge customer provided high & low res imagery into a seamless layer for complete coverage.
||| :icon-paper-airplane: <h4>Map widget</h4>
Pozi Pro's map widget that allows you to embed an address search box on your website to launch a custom map. Users simply enter an address and Pozi Pro will launch its map featuring their chosen location.
||| :icon-code-square: <h4>Information widget</h4>
Different from Map Widget, the Information Widget allows an address search field to be embedded on your website to display property-specific information (without a map launch), such as council bin collection dates.
|||

<br/>

### Filtering, GPS tracking and bookmarks

||| :icon-sort-desc: <h4>Layer filter & mulit-select</h4>
Layer filtering allows users to pick the subset of visual data and detail specifically what you would like viewable on a map. Users can select multiple properties in Pozi Pro by defining areas of interest.
||| :icon-milestone: <h4>GPS tracking</h4>
Pozi Pro has optional constant GPS tracking that follows users as they walk or drive, allowing easy identification of assets and other roadside features as they travel.
||| :icon-bookmark: <h4>Custom bookmarking</h4>
Pozi Pro can generate custom map links to control exactly how the app appears to users. Focus your users' attention on what you want them to see, hiding unneeded datasets and buttons. Especially helpful for customer service and emailing map information specific to the customer.
