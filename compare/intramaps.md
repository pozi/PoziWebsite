# IntraMaps vs Pozi

Is IntraMaps no longer growing with you or serving your organisation's needs?

Pozi is the enterprise GIS viewer with the all features your users need, plus real support.

## Why choose Pozi over IntraMaps?

### Ultimate Control

Pozi's open architecture enables your organisation to operate on its terms, in its preferred environment, with its preferred infrastructure and resources.

On-premise, cloud or hybrid. The choice is yours.

Pozi respects your organisation's autonomy and strategic technology decisions.

### Direct Integration

Connect your users directly with your organisation's spatial data library plus live data from corporate applications, government data services and web APIs.

Pozi delivers live information from trusted sources to your users - not copies or snapshots that require complex workflows for compiling, processing and uploading data.

### Ease of Use

Pozi's ease of use improves user engagement and promotes more informed decision-making.

Users don't require expensive training to get the answers they need.

Pozi enables users across your organisation to quickly access critical information, regardless of any previous GIS expertise.

Pozi's adaptive interface displays only the information needed for the task at hand, whether it's visualising the map at full screen, viewing details about a selected feature or location, browsing available map layers, or searching for a location. By freeing up valuable screen space, users gain more insight and context around their area of interest.

* intuitive workflows
* touch friendly, mobile friendly
* efficient use of screen space, free of clutter
* no complex tools, menus or jargon
* modern, visually-appealing interface

### Ease of Configuration

Pozi enables GIS administrators to quickly and easily distribute spatial information across your organisation.

If you know how to use QGIS, you can publish data in Pozi.

There are no multi-day courses required to get you started.

Take advantage of QGIS's powerful graphical user interface to configure your layers in Pozi, including adding spatial and non-spatial data sources, filtering, advanced layer styling, labelling, dynamic data joins, virtual fields, debugging tools, and more.

### Public Ready

Engage your community and external stakeholders with information that's relevant to them while keeping your organisation's internal data available only to internal users.

Every Pozi site provides a public-facing map view by default.

Synchronise selected datasets from your network to the Pozi cloud platform for viewing by the public.

And engage with the public using Pozi's two-way community consultation functionality. Gather information from the public about incidents, maintenance requests, feedback on strategic initiatives, community story-telling, and more.

### Modules vs Bookmarks

*Sick of maintaining multiple map modules?*

Pozi frees you from duplicating your configuration across separate modules. Pozi gives your end-users their own personalised view based on a single map.

When users interact with layer groups within the layer panel, Pozi remembers how they left it so that their most relevant layers are ready to toggle on and off as needed. Layers that aren't useful or haven't been recently accessed remain tucked away.

Users can also bookmark the current state of the Pozi map, enabling them to launch Pozi with their frequently-used map layers displayed by default.

Pozi can be launched from saved views to suit specific workflows, projects or themes. There's no limit to the number of bookmarks you can create and share. Users can also share customised map views with others to highlight specific areas or layers of interest.

Pozi avoids the overhead of duplicating configuration across multiple modules, while enabling users to discover and use information for their individual needs.

### Performance

Users get the answers they need quicker in Pozi. The Pozi web app opens in seconds, and even faster for regular users due to its intelligent caching.

### Real Support

*When you ask Pozi for help, we'll acknowledge your request within 24 hours, and begin resolving your issue within 48 hours.*

Pozi clients benefit from being able to communicate directly with development and support crew during solution implementations and ongoing support.

#### Have your own preferred GIS support provider?

Do you already have your own GIS support provider? No worries. We'll work with them and provide access to the resources they need to deliver the support you deserve.

We don't put restrictions on who you ask for support. Pozi's open architecture enables any GIS support provider to customise and maintain Pozi to your organisation's requirements.

### Purpose-Driven

Pozi is solely focussed on the spatial enablement of your organisation. We have no interest in creating closed ecosystems to capture your organisation's other business functions.

Pozi's open platform integrates with major vendor platforms and applications to enable maximum interoperability, providing your organisation with autonomy in its strategic technology decisions.

### Future Ready

The future of web GIS is driven by live data integrations, web-optimised data formats and in-browser geo-processing.

Pozi invests for the future by keeping Pozi up-to-date with modern web technologies. We work with open source HTML5 technologies including [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Material UI](https://mui.com/), [OpenLayers 6](https://openlayers.org/), [TurfJS](https://turfjs.org/) and [GeoStyler](https://geostyler.org/) to ensure high performance, compatibility with modern data sources, and a high quality user experience.

IntraMaps is built on top of an outdated version of OpenLayers, which ceased development in 2013. IntraMaps' performance and functionality remain tied to a legacy, unsupported code base, preventing any significant innovation in performance and functionality.

### Transparent Pricing
