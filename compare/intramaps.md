title: Pozi vs IntraMaps
---

## Why choose Pozi over IntraMaps?

### Ease of Use

### Modules vs Bookmarks

Pozi enables any user to have their own personalised map view without you having to maintain separate modules.

From the one master layer catalogue, users can bookmark the current state of the Pozi map in their browser, which enables them to launch Pozi with their favourite map layers displayed.

When users interact with layer groups within the layer control, Pozi remembers the current state so that relevant layers are ready to toggle on and off as needed. Layers that are not relevant to a particular user can remain tucked away.

There is no limit to the number of bookmarks that users create, so users can have multiple ways of launching Pozi to suit specific workflows or projects. This method of saving maps is also used to share links, so that staff can share customised maps showing specific areas and layers.

Pozi avoids the overhead of duplicating configuration across multiple modules. At the same time, it enables staff to discover and use information outside of artificial data silos.

### Real Support

### Ultimate Control

We work with clients on their terms, in their preferred environment, with their preferred infrastructure and resources.

On-premise, cloud or a combination. The choice is yours.

Our open system avoids vendor lock-in by respecting our clients' autonomy and strategic technology decisions.

### Transparent Pricing

### Anything Missing?

We'll build it for you!

That's right. If you need any functionality that's not already in Pozi, we will provide an estimate based on your specification. If we build it, you will have ongoing access to the new features for the life of your subscription.

## IntraMaps is right for you if...

==- You need to publish your own base map

Pozi supports a variety of commercial, government and community basemaps, and allows custom styling for vector tile basemaps. It even allows you to use QGIS for creating a custom basemap for internal use.

However if you need your public users to use your custom basemap, then IntraMaps may be the right option for you.

==- You need to isolate layers on different maps

Pozi allows permitted users to discover and turn on any combination of permitted map layers. Users can even create bookmarks for maps that contain the layers they commonly use.

If you need to prevent layers from one group/type/source/department being displayed on the same map as layers from other group, then you'll want to use modules in IntraMaps to isolate these layers.

==- Users need to use circle or rectangle selection tools

Pozi enables users to query the map based a point of interest (single click) or by drawing an area of interest with the polygon selection tool.

If your users require selections based on circles or rectangles, then IntraMaps may be the right option for you.

==- Users use it to launch legacy Windows applications

While Pozi enables linking to installed Windows applications that support [URL protocol handlers](/PoziWebsite/tags/url-protocol-handler/), it is mostly designed for integrations with modern web applications through REST APIs and simple URLs.

If your users have specialised Windows applications that they launch from customised IntraMaps application launchers, then IntraMaps will continue to serve them for years to come.

## Considerations

* it's worthwhile taking a critical look at existing systems to evaluate their value and effectiveness
* it's OK to switch providers in order to get better support
* GIS budgets can be put to better use in funding the development of functionality your users need
* evolution of a council's GIS can be achieved without tenders/RFQs, data migration or significant retraining

## Better Outcomes with Pozi

* staff can expect to get answers quicker with a faster, simpler application built around their needs
* GIS administrators can expect reduction in administration overheads due to direct integration with live data from internal and external sources (eg, reduce need for downloading, processing and republishing data from government and other sources; reduce overnight processing/duplication of corporate data)
* council can expect to see its GIS become more advanced by using its GIS budget to fund the development of any new functionality to serve its users
