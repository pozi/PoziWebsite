title: Pozi vs IntraMaps
---

## Why choose Pozi over IntraMaps?

### Ease of Use

### Modules vs Bookmarks

Pozi enables any user to have their own personalised map view without you having to maintain separate modules.

From the one master layer catalogue, users can bookmark the current state of the Pozi map in their browser, which enables them to launch Pozi with their favourite map layers displayed. And when users interact with layer groups within the layer control, Pozi remembers the current state so that relevant layers are ready to toggle on and off as needed. Layers that are not relevant to a particular user can remain tucked away.

There is no limit to the number of bookmarks that users create, so staff can have multiple ways of launching Pozi to suit specific workflows or projects. This method of saving maps is also used to share links, so that staff can share customised maps showing specific areas and layers.

By having a single map, Pozi avoids the overhead of duplicating configuration across multiple modules. At the same time, it enables staff to discover and use information outside of artificial data silos.

### Real Support

## IntraMaps is right for you if...

==- You need to publish your own base map

Pozi supports a variety of commercial, government and community basemaps, and allows custom styling for vector tile basemaps. It even allows you to use QGIS for creating a custom basemap for internal use. However if you need your public users to use your custom basemap, then IntraMaps may be the right option for you.
