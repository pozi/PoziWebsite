# IntraMaps vs Pozi

Is IntraMaps no longer growing with you or serving your organisation's needs?

Pozi is the enterprise GIS viewer with the all features your users need, plus real support.

## Why choose Pozi over IntraMaps?

### Ultimate Control

Pozi's open architecture enables your organisation to operate on its terms, in its preferred environment, with its preferred infrastructure and resources.

On-premise, cloud or hybrid. The choice is yours.

Pozi respects your organisation's autonomy and strategic technology decisions.

### Ease of Use

Users don't require expensive training to get the answers they need.

Pozi's focus on simplicity and ease of use enables users to quickly access critical information, regardless of any previous GIS expertise.

Pozi's adaptive interface displays only the information needed for the task at hand, whether it's visualising the map at full screen, viewing details about a selected feature or location, browsing available map layers, or searching for a location. By freeing up valuable screen space, users gain more insight and context around their focus area.

* intuitive workflows
* touch friendly, mobile friendly
* efficient use of screen space, free of clutter
* no complex tools, menus or jargon
* modern, visually-appealing interface

Pozi's ease of use improves user engagement and promotes more informed decision-making.

### Ease of Configuration

Pozi enables GIS administrators to quickly and easily distribute spatial information across your organisation.

If you know how to use QGIS, you can publish data in Pozi.

There are no multi-day courses required to get you started.

Take advantage of QGIS's powerful graphical user interface to configure your layers in Pozi, including adding spatial and non-spatial data sources, filtering, advanced layer styling, labelling, dynamic data joins, virtual fields, debugging tools, and more.

### Public Ready

Engage your community and external stakeholders with information that's relevant to them while keeping your organisation's internal data available only to internal users.

Every Pozi site provides a public-facing map view by default.

Synchronise selected datasets from your network to the Pozi cloud platform for viewing by the public.

And engage with the public using Pozi's two-way community consultation functionality. Gather information from the public about incidents, maintenance requests, feedback on strategic initiatives, community story-telling, and more.

### Modules vs Bookmarks

*Sick of maintaining multiple map modules?*

Pozi frees you from duplicating your configuration across separate modules. Pozi gives your end-users their own personalised view based on a single map.

From the one map, users can bookmark the current state of the Pozi map in their browser, enabling them to launch Pozi with their frequently-used map layers displayed by default.

When users interact with layer groups within the layer panel, Pozi remembers how they left it so that their most relevant layers are ready to toggle on and off as needed. Layers that aren't useful or haven't been recently accessed remain tucked away.

Users can launch Pozi from saved views to suit specific workflows or projects. There's no limit to the number of bookmarks you can create. Users can also share customised map views with others to highlight specific areas or layers of interest.

Pozi avoids the overhead of duplicating configuration across multiple modules, while enabling users to discover and use information without artificial data silos.

### Performance

Users get the answers they need quicker in Pozi. The Pozi web app opens in seconds, and even faster on return visits due to its intelligent caching.

### Real Support

*When you ask Pozi for help, we'll acknowledge your request within 24 hours, and begin resolving your issue within 48 hours.*

Pozi clients benefit from being able to communicate directly with development and support crew during solution implementations and ongoing support.

#### Have your own preferred GIS support provider?

Do you already have your own GIS support provider? No worries. We'll work with them to ensure the best outcome for you.

We don't put restrictions on who you ask for support. Pozi's open architecture ensures that any GIS support provider with basic knowledge of QGIS can customise and maintain Pozi to your organisation's requirements.

### Purpose-Driven

Pozi is solely focussed on the spatial enablement of your organisation. We have no interest or agenda in creating closed ecosystems to capture your organisation's other business functions.

Pozi's open platform integrates with major vendor platforms and other purpose-built technologies to enable maximum interoperability, providing your organisation with autonomy in its strategic technology decisions.

### Future Ready

The future of web GIS is driven by web-optimised data formats and in-browser geo-processing.

Pozi invests for the future by keeping Pozi up-to-date with modern web technologies. We work with open source HTML5 technologies including React, Material UI, OpenLayers 6, TurfJS and GeoStyler to ensure achieve high performance, compatibility with modern data sources, and a high quality user experience.

IntraMaps is built on top of an outdated version of OpenLayers, which ceased development in 2013. IntraMaps' performance and functionality remain tied to a legacy, unsupported code base, and its users cannot take advantage of modern interfaces, data sources and formats.

### Transparent Pricing

No long-term, lock-in contracts. No hidden costs.

Our pricing is on our website.

## IntraMaps may be right for you if...

==- Your organisation requires a single vendor for its technology requirements

IntraMaps is one of many software titles in the TechnologyOne suite. If your organisation needs a single point of contact for all its technology needs, then TechnologyOne's offering will suit your organisation.

==- You have access to a third party provider to support your existing IntraMaps

If your IntraMaps contract allows you to get support from an independent provider, and they've proven they can keep IntraMaps working to suit your organisation's needs, then IntraMaps can still be a viable option for you.

Ensure you check the TechnologyOne roadmap for upcoming changes that might affect the autonomy your organisation maintains over its corporate spatial data.

==- Users use it to launch legacy Windows applications

While Pozi enables linking to Windows applications that support [URL protocol handlers](/tags/url-protocol-handler/), some applications may rely on a custom IntraMaps application launcher.

As long as the integrations continue to be supported, then IntraMaps may be right for you.

==- You need to publish your own custom base map to external users

Pozi enables your site to make use of a variety of commercial, government and community basemaps, and also allows custom styling for vector tile basemaps. It can even use any QGIS project or MapServer map file as a basemap for internal users.

However if you need your public users to use a custom basemap that you maintain, then IntraMaps may be the right option for you.

==- You need to isolate layers on different maps

Pozi allows permitted users to discover and turn on any combination of permitted map layers. Users can even create bookmarks for maps that contain the combination of layers they commonly use.

However if you need to prevent layers of one type being displayed on the same map as layers of another type, then you'll want to use modules in IntraMaps to isolate these layers from one another.

==- Users need to use circle or rectangle selection tools

Pozi enables users to query the map based by a single click or by drawing an area of interest of any shape with the polygon selection tool.

If your users require selections based on strict circles or rectangles, then IntraMaps may be the right option for you.
