## Why choose Pozi over IntraMaps?

### Ultimate Control

We work with clients on their terms, in their preferred environment, with their preferred infrastructure and resources.

On-premise, cloud or a combination. The choice is yours.

Pozi's open architecture avoids vendor lock-in by respecting our clients' autonomy and strategic technology decisions.

### Ease of Use

Users don't require expensive training to get the answers they need. When tools are simple and intuitive, you improve user engagement.

From its beginning as a public-facing map enquiry tool, Pozi has focussed on delivering critical information to users regardless of any previous GIS expertise.

* touch friendly
* efficient use of screen space
* no complex tools, menus or jargon

### Modules vs Bookmarks

*Sick of maintaining multiple map modules?*

Pozi enables any user to have their own personalised map view without you having to maintain separate modules.

From the one master layer catalogue, users can bookmark the current state of the Pozi map in their browser, which enables them to launch Pozi with their frequently-used map layers displayed by default.

When users interact with layer groups within the layer panel, Pozi remembers the current state of the panel so that relevant layers are ready to toggle on and off as needed. Layers that are not relevant to a particular user remain tucked away.

There is no limit to the number of bookmarks that users create, so users can have multiple ways of launching Pozi to suit specific workflows or projects. This method of saving maps is also used to share links, so that staff can share customised maps showing specific areas and layers.

Pozi avoids the overhead of duplicating configuration across multiple modules. At the same time, it enables staff to discover and use information outside of artificial data silos.

### Performance

### Real Support

*When you ask Pozi for help, we'll acknowledge your request within 24 hours, and begin resolving your issue within 48 hours.*

Pozi clients benefit from being able to communicate directly with development and support staff during solution implementations and ongoing support.

### Purpose-Driven

Pozi is solely focussed on building spatial technologies to drive business efficiencies and community engagement. To achieve that, we develop an open platform that integrates with other purpose-built technologies. We have no interest in creating closed ecosystems to capture all your business functions.

### Future Ready

The future of web GIS will be driven by technologies such as vector tiles and in-browser geo-processing.

Pozi invests for the future by with continuous development and keeping Pozi up-to-date with modern web technologies.

Pozi uses modern HTML5 web technologies, including OpenLayers 6, ensuring high performance, compatibility with newer data sources, and an improved user experience.

IntraMaps is built around OpenLayers 2, which ceased development in 2013. As long as IntraMaps stays on this legacy version of OpenLayers, its performance will be restricted, and it will be prevented from integrating modern data sources.

### Transparent Pricing

No long-term, lock-in contracts. No hidden costs.

Our pricing is on our website.

[!ref icon="briefcase"](/pricing/)

Hosting and basic support is included in your subscription. Initial setup and advanced support is available on-demand at our standard rate. You don't need a support contract to ask us for help.

And we will never charge you for fixing a bug.

### Anything Missing?

We'll build it for you!

That's right. If you need any functionality that's not already in Pozi, talk to us about your requirements. We'll collaborate with you on a specification to suit your exact requirements and provide an estimate for its development.

When you fund the development of new features, you have ongoing access to the new functionality for the life of your subscription.

## Better Outcomes with Pozi

* staff can expect to get answers quicker with a faster, simpler application built around their needs
* GIS administrators can expect reduction in administration overheads due to direct integration with live data from internal and external sources (eg, reduce need for downloading, processing and republishing data from government and other sources; reduce overnight processing/duplication of corporate data)
* council can expect to see its GIS become more advanced by using its GIS budget to fund the development of any new functionality to serve its users

## Unhappy with IntraMaps?

* it's worthwhile taking a critical look at existing software to evaluate the value it's currently providing
* it's OK to switch providers in order to get better support
* GIS budgets can be put to better use by using lower-cost solutions and funding the development of functionality your users need
* evolution of a council's GIS can be achieved without tenders/RFQs, data migration or significant retraining

### On a contract?

If you're stuck in another contract, talk to us. Not only can we get you up and running with Pozi straight away, we'll provide credit for your use of Pozi during the remainder of your existing contract!

## IntraMaps is right for you if...

==- Your organisation needs a single vendor for its technology requirements

IntraMaps is one of many corporate software titles in the TechnologyOne suite. If your organisation needs a single point of contact for all its technology needs, then TechnologyOne's offering will suit your organisation.

==- You're getting support from a third party provider

If you have access to support from an independent provider and they continue to keep IntraMaps working to suit your organisation's needs, then IntraMaps can still be a viable option for you.

==- Users use it to launch legacy Windows applications

While Pozi enables linking to Windows applications that support [URL protocol handlers](/tags/url-protocol-handler/), it's primarily designed for integrations with modern web applications through REST APIs and standard URLs.

If your users have specialised Windows applications that they launch from custom-built IntraMaps application launchers, then IntraMaps will provide the backwards-compatibility you need for as long as these custom launchers are supported.

==- You need to publish your own custom base map to external users

Pozi supports a variety of commercial, government and community basemaps, and allows custom styling for vector tile basemaps. It even allows you to use QGIS for creating a custom basemap for internal use.

However if you need your public users to use an internally-maintained custom basemap, then IntraMaps may be the right option for you.

==- You need to isolate layers on different maps

Pozi allows permitted users to discover and turn on any combination of permitted map layers. Users can even create bookmarks for maps that contain the combination of layers they commonly use.

However if you need to prevent layers of one type being displayed on the same map as layers of another type, then you'll want to use modules in IntraMaps to isolate these layers from one another.

==- Users need to use circle or rectangle selection tools

Pozi enables users to query the map based by a single click or by drawing an area of interest with the polygon selection tool.

If your users require selections based on circles or rectangles, then IntraMaps may be the right option for you.
