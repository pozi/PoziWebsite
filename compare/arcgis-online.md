# ArcGIS Online vs Pozi

Is ArcGIS Online beyond your budget?

Pozi is the enterprise GIS viewer with the all features your users need, plus real support.

## Why choose Pozi over ArcGIS Online?

### Direct Integration

Connect your users directly with your organisation's spatial data library, plus live data from corporate applications, government data services and web APIs.

Pozi delivers live information from trusted sources to your users - not copies or snapshots that you upload to the web.

### Ease of Configuration

Pozi enables GIS administrators to quickly and easily distribute spatial information across your organisation.

If you know how to use QGIS, you can publish data in Pozi.

There are no multi-day courses required to get you started.

GIS administrators can take advantage of QGIS's powerful graphical user interface to configure layers in Pozi, including adding spatial and non-spatial data sources, filtering, advanced layer styling, labelling, dynamic data joins, virtual fields, debugging tools, and more.

### Functionality

Here's what our customers have to say about Pozi in comparison with their experience with ArcGIS Experience Builder.

==- About Pozi

> A stable team of technicians based in Australia who could manage updates and customisation

> interface is more lightweight and includes Google Street View and nearby assets/features by default

> allows members of the public to lodge information about community engagement projects, development applications, customer requests

> able to embed search boxes into Council websites and SharePoint sites which searches any dataset and returns results in the webpage (e.g. "What is my Bin Day?")

> Better layer searching

> Better bookmarks and GPS tracking

> Better labelling and drawing on the map with a print preview

==- About ArcGIS Experience Builder

> lack of updates to the Developer Editions of Experience Builder as opposed to the ArcGIS Online

> extra overheads of costs to maintain a separate server for the local host database which could only be accessed within the Council network

> this solution required custom coding and manual updating script files, republishing and transferring bundles of code to a separate server every time an update would come though

> annotation / Drawing tools did not work well

> there was limited print preview and customising layouts

> couldn't do the Community Engagement Solution that we wanted to do.
