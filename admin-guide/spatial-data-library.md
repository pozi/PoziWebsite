A well-structured data library makes it easy for organisations to maintain up-to-date data from internal and external sources.

Organisations can more easily manage data, reduce duplication, and identify sources when datasets are stored in a standard location.

## Data Library Structure

The recommended structure is a network folder hierarchy based on the name of each dataset's source organisation or department. Every dataset has a single source, and only one possible location in the hierarchy.

When naming of the network folders, it is acceptable to use any recognisable abbreviations for organisation names (eg DELWP) to keep file paths short. Individual dataset folder names are also abbreviated where the data supplier also uses a standard abbreviation (eg AAV, CIP, VMPROP).
