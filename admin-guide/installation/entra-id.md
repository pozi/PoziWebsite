# Entra ID Application Proxy

:::updated
27 Oct 2023
:::

Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) provides an Application Proxy service that enables users to securely access on-premises applications from outside the organisations' internal network without the need for a VPN.

This document aims to help your organisation set up this Application Proxy for Pozi QGIS Server.

**Required permissions**:
* Administrator permissions on the on-premises server where QGIS resides
* An Entra ID service account with [Application Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator) permissions


!!!Please read carefully before executing the steps below.

This guide is based on (and refers to) steps outlined in the following Microsoft tutorial:

[Tutorial: Add an on-premises application for remote access through Application Proxy in Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/entra/identity/app-proxy/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application)


This document assumes that the first 2 steps ([Prerequisites](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/entra/identity/app-proxy/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application#prerequisites) and [Prepare your on-premises environment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/entra/identity/app-proxy/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application#prepare-your-on-premises-environment)) of the tutorial have been followed and executed.

Entra ID's features and portal update frequently and this guide may not fully reflect the latest changes.
Please [contact us](/contact/) if you experience any inconstencies so we can update the documentation.

!!!

Visit the Microsoft Entra ID portal using https://entra.microsoft.com/


<!-- The relevant sections can be found in the following menu structure:

  - Enterprise Applications
  - App Registrations -->


## 1. Install connector on on-premises server

The connector is an a required piece of software that manages the outbound connection from the on-premises application servers to Application Proxy in Microsoft Entra ID. It will run as a service.

**Tutorial**: [Install and register a connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/entra/identity/app-proxy/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application#install-and-register-a-connector)

![](img/entra-id/entra-id-download-connector.png)

* Click on 'Download connector service', 'Accept terms & Download'
* Transfer downloaded file (e.g. 'AADApplicationProxyConnectorInstaller.exe') to the on-premises server
* Run the installer and follow the instructions

## 3. Application Proxy (Enterprise Application)

`Entra ID`: **Enterprise Applications** ⇒ **Server** ⇒ **Application Proxy**


+++ Preferred

*IIS + QGIS Server only (i.e. without Pozi Connect Server)*

The following settings are for a Pozi server setup with only QGIS Server and IIS.

* **Internal URL** : `http://<servername>/pozi/`. Replace `<servername>` with the actual name of the server.

  To test internal URL on the internal network, opening the following URL in the browser should show a QGIS Server landing page:`http://<servername>/pozi/qgisserver/wfs3`

* **External URL**: `https://poziserver-<clientname>.msappproxy.net/pozi/`.

  The `<clientname>` is a name that has been given to the organisation by MS Azure. The URL `https://poziserver-<clientname>.msappproxy.net/pozi/qgisserver/wfs3` should show the same landing page as in the Internal URL section above.

* **Pre Authentication**: `Azure Active Directory`.

Do **not** choose `Passthrough` as that will allow any user (logged in or not) to access private resources from the server.

When configured correctly, a request from a logged-in user to URL (for example)...

`https://poziserver-<clientname>.msappproxy.net/pozi/qgisserver/wfs3.json`

...should return the same response as a local request to...

`http://<servername>/pozi/qgisserver/wfs3.json`

Ensure it doesn't return a response to a non-logged-in or anonymous user.

+++ Legacy

*Pozi Connect Server + local DNS*

The following settings are for a Pozi server setup with a Pozi Server installation that proxies all QGIS Server and IIS requests.

* **Internal URL** : `https://local.pozi.com` (or any other URL that uses a local DNS with a locally signed SSL certificate pointing to the server that runs PoziServer)

  When visiting the above URL on the internal network, it should show a Pozi Connect Server welcome page.

All other settings here (like **External URL** and **Pre Authentication** are the same as above)

When configured correctly, a request from a logged-in user to URL (for example)...

`https://poziserver-<clientname>.msappproxy.net/resourcecheck/<sitename>.json`

...should return the same response as a local request to...

`https://local.pozi.com/resourcecheck/<sitename>.json`

Ensure it doesn't return a response to a non-logged-in or anonymous user.

+++

### Other settings

<!-- ![](/dev-guide/img/azure-settings.png){style="width:600px"} -->

**Advanced**:

* **Translate URLs in headers**: ☑
* **Translate URLs in application body**: ☑
* **Validate Backend SSL certificate**: ☑

## App Registration

`Entra ID`: **App Registrations** ⇒ **Server**

* Set Pozi up in Azure as a registered app (admin privileges required): [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#register-an-application-with-azure-ad-and-create-a-service-principal)
* Record the Application id (also known as as client id) as well as tenant id

### Authentication

#### Web - Redirect URIs

Add the App Proxy URL to `Redirect URIs` to the `Web` section. E.g.:
  * `https://poziserver-<clientname>.msappproxy.net/pozi/`

This is the same as the External URL configured above.

![](../integrations/img/azure-auth-web-redirect-uris.png)

#### Single Page Application - Redirect URIs

Add the following `Redirect URIs` to the `Single-page application` section:
  * `https://<sitename>.enterprise.pozi.com/`
  * `http://localhost:3000/` (for Pozi development purposes)
  * `https://staging.pozi.com/` (for client testing/debugging)

If upgrading an existing non-Azure Pozi Enterprise site, also add a URI for a dedicated test site with `-azure` appended to the existing site name:
  * `https://<sitename>-azure.enterprise.pozi.com/`

![](../integrations/img/azure-auth-spa-redirect-uris.png)

Please make sure that the URIs all have a trailing slash ('/') and note that the localhost URI is `http` (and not `https`).

### Implicit grant and hybrid flows

* `Access tokens` and `ID tokens` should remain unchecked

![](../integrations/img/azure-auth-implicit-grant-and-hybrid-flows.png)

### Advanced settings

* Set `Allow public client flows` to `No`

![](../integrations/img/azure-auth-advanced-settings.png)

### Authorisation

All going well, it should be possible to visit the App Proxy URL (in our example case: `https://poziserver-<clientname>.msappproxy.net/pozi/`). If an error is shown like: `Sorry, but we’re having trouble with signing you in.` with a text similar to below, then we will need to give the relevant users/groups access.

:::note Example authorisation error:

AADSTS50105: Your administrator has configured the application Pozi Server ('xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx') to block users unless they are specifically granted ('assigned') access to the application. The signed in user 'xxxxxxxxx.xxxxxxx@xxxxxxxxxxx.xxx.xxx.xx') is blocked because they are not a direct member of a group with access, nor had access directly assigned by an administrator. Please contact your administrator to assign access to this application.

:::

**Steps to authorise users/groups**

`Entra ID`: **Enterprise Applications** ⇒ **Server**

* In the Azure Portal, go to Enterprise Applications, select the enterprise application for the Pozi Application Proxy
* Under `Manage`, select `Users and groups`
* If no users/groups have been defined, it will say something like `No application assignments found`
* Click on `+ Add user/group`
* In the next page, click on the text `None selected` under`Users and groups
* On the right a panel should pop up with all available users/groups. Assuming that we want all users to have access, click on the group `All users` and click on `Select` in the bottom.
* It is worth taking note of the the info text `When you assign a group to an application, only users directly in the group will have access. The assignment does not cascade to nested groups.`, especially when one chooses a group that contains other groups. In the case of `All users`, this is not an issue.
* Under `Select a role`, the role `User` is preselected and cannot be changed. That is OK.
* Click on `Assign` in the bottom of the page.

Access should now be granted to the application proxy and the URL should be accessible.

### API Permissions

Give Pozi the following permissions:

- API/Permissions Name: `User.Read`
- Type: `Delegated`
- Admin consent required: `No`

This should allow Pozi to determine access based on a user's role(s).

<!-- Important: a user authenticated with the client's Azure AD through Pozi will need to their tokens to have been provided with permission to access all of the App Proxy (i.e. `https://poziserver-<clientname>.msappproxy.net/`). -->

## Azure AD Pozi Support Account

In order for the Pozi team to be able to provide support and troubleshoot any potential issues, we ask our clients to configure the [Pozi Support](prerequisites.md#support-account) domain user with the same permissions/groups/roles as the users of Pozi through Azure AD Application Proxy.

If it's not possible or practical for the Pozi Support domain user to be given Azure AD permissions, you may choose to create a separate user account with the Azure AD permissions. In this case, no administrator privileges are required.

## Information to send to Pozi

After completion of the configuration, email us with the following information:

- [ ] The **internal** app proxy URl (something like `http://<servername>/pozi/`)
- [ ] The **external** app proxy URl (something like `https://poziserver-<clientname>.msappproxy.net/pozi/`)
- [ ] The **`client id`** (sometimes called 'application id') and has the following structure: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx. The client id is defined in Enterprise Applications => Properties.
- [ ] The **`tenant id`**, which looks like xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx. The tenant id is defined in Azure Active Directory => Overview."
- [ ] A copy/paste and/or screenshot of all the relevant settings

This information is [not sensitive](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57306964/are-azure-active-directorys-tenantid-and-clientid-considered-secrets) and can be emailed directly to the Pozi support team at support@pozi.com.

In addition to the information above, if you have not done so already, provide the Azure AD credentials (email address and password) of the [Pozi Support](prerequisites.md#support-account) user account. Please get in touch with us on how to securely provide us with these details.

<!-- ### App Roles

:::note Under Construction

*This section is a work in progress. Please get in touch with us before following any of the steps below*

:::

It is possible to assign app roles to users and groups and make those roles available through our token-based authentication/authorisation (which is currently still experimental).

The instructions below follow the [Microsoft guide on adding app roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps).

#### Create App Roles

* Go to the App Proxy application in the `App registrations` sections and select `App roles`
* Create the following app role for read access to Pozi Server:
  - Display name: `Pozi Server Read Access`
  - Allowed member types: `Users/Groups`
  - Value: `PoziServer.Read`
  - Description: `Read access to Pozi Server`
  - Do you want to enable this app role?: `✔`
* Create the following app role for write access to Pozi Server:
  - Display name: `Pozi Server Write Access`
  - Allowed member types: `Users/Groups`
  - Value: `PoziServer.Write`
  - Description: `Write access to Pozi Server`
  - Do you want to enable this app role?: `✔`

#### Assign App Roles to Users/Groups

* Go to the App Proxy application in the `Enterprise applications` section and in the `Manage` category, select `Users and groups`
* Select all users/groups that should get read access to Pozi Server and click on `Edit` in the top of the page
* Click on `Select a role` and select the role `Pozi Server Read Access` and click on `Select` in the bottom of the page
* For enabling write access follow the same steps again but now select the role `Pozi Server Write Access`
* Currently, the Azure UI shows one row per role per user/group. That is expected behaviour.

#### App Roles in Tokens

* The roles defined above will automatically become available in the authentication tokens in the browser, allowing Pozi to change its behaviour depending on the roles that the user (or the group they are in) have. -->
