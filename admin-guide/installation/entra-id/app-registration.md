# App Registration

:::updated
30 Oct 2023
:::


This guide is based on (and refers to) steps outlined in the following Microsoft document:

[Create a Microsoft Entra application and service principal that can access resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal)


## 1. Register Pozi Web Application with Microsoft Entra ID

[Register an application with Microsoft Entra ID and create a service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal#register-an-application-with-azure-ad-and-create-a-service-principal)


## 99. App registration



`Entra ID`: **App Registrations** ⇒ **Server**

* Set Pozi Server up in Entra ID as a registered app (admin privileges required): [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#register-an-application-with-azure-ad-and-create-a-service-principal)
* Record the Application id (also known as as client id) as well as tenant id

### Authentication

#### Web - Redirect URIs

Add the App Proxy URL to `Redirect URIs` to the `Web` section. E.g.:
  * `https://poziserver-<entra-application-client-id>.msappproxy.net/pozi/`

This is the same as the External URL configured above.

#### Single Page Application - Redirect URIs

Add the following `Redirect URIs` to the `Single-page application` section:
  * `https://<sitename>.enterprise.pozi.com/`
  * `http://localhost:3000/` (for Pozi development purposes)
  * `https://staging.pozi.com/` (for client testing/debugging)

If upgrading an existing non-Azure Pozi Enterprise site, also add a URI for a dedicated test site with `-azure` appended to the existing site name:
  * `https://<sitename>-azure.enterprise.pozi.com/`

![](../integrations/img/azure-auth-spa-redirect-uris.png)

Please make sure that the URIs all have a trailing slash ('/') and note that the localhost URI is `http` (and not `https`).

### Implicit grant and hybrid flows

* `Access tokens` and `ID tokens` should remain unchecked

![](../integrations/img/azure-auth-implicit-grant-and-hybrid-flows.png)

### Advanced settings

* Set `Allow public client flows` to `No`

![](../integrations/img/azure-auth-advanced-settings.png)

### Authorisation

All going well, it should be possible to visit the App Proxy URL (in our example case: `https://poziserver-<entra-application-client-id>.msappproxy.net/pozi/`). If an error is shown like: `Sorry, but we’re having trouble with signing you in.` with a text similar to below, then we will need to give the relevant users/groups access.

:::note Example authorisation error:

AADSTS50105: Your administrator has configured the application Pozi Server ('xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx') to block users unless they are specifically granted ('assigned') access to the application. The signed in user 'xxxxxxxxx.xxxxxxx@xxxxxxxxxxx.xxx.xxx.xx') is blocked because they are not a direct member of a group with access, nor had access directly assigned by an administrator. Please contact your administrator to assign access to this application.

:::

**Steps to authorise users/groups**

`Entra ID`: **Enterprise Applications** ⇒ **Server**

* In the Azure Portal, go to Enterprise Applications, select the enterprise application for the Pozi Application Proxy
* Under `Manage`, select `Users and groups`
* If no users/groups have been defined, it will say something like `No application assignments found`
* Click on `+ Add user/group`
* In the next page, click on the text `None selected` under`Users and groups
* On the right a panel should pop up with all available users/groups. Assuming that we want all users to have access, click on the group `All users` and click on `Select` in the bottom.
* It is worth taking note of the the info text `When you assign a group to an application, only users directly in the group will have access. The assignment does not cascade to nested groups.`, especially when one chooses a group that contains other groups. In the case of `All users`, this is not an issue.
* Under `Select a role`, the role `User` is preselected and cannot be changed. That is OK.
* Click on `Assign` in the bottom of the page.

Access should now be granted to the application proxy and the URL should be accessible.

### API Permissions

Give Pozi the following permissions:

- API/Permissions Name: `User.Read`
- Type: `Delegated`
- Admin consent required: `No`

This should allow Pozi to determine access based on a user's role(s).

<!-- Important: a user authenticated with the client's Azure AD through Pozi will need to their tokens to have been provided with permission to access all of the App Proxy (i.e. `https://poziserver-<entra-application-client-id>.msappproxy.net/`). -->

## Azure AD Pozi Support Account

In order for the Pozi team to be able to provide support and troubleshoot any potential issues, we ask our clients to configure the [Pozi Support](prerequisites.md#support-account) domain user with the same permissions/groups/roles as the users of Pozi through Azure AD Application Proxy.

If it's not possible or practical for the Pozi Support domain user to be given Azure AD permissions, you may choose to create a separate user account with the Azure AD permissions. In this case, no administrator privileges are required.

## Information to send to Pozi

After completion of the configuration, email us with the following information:

- [ ] The **internal** app proxy URl (something like `http://<internal-server-name>/pozi/`)
- [ ] The **external** app proxy URl (something like `https://poziserver-<entra-application-client-id>.msappproxy.net/pozi/`)
- [ ] The **`client id`** (sometimes called 'application id') and has the following structure: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx. The client id is defined in Enterprise Applications => Properties.
- [ ] The **`tenant id`**, which looks like xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx. The tenant id is defined in Azure Active Directory => Overview."
- [ ] A copy/paste and/or screenshot of all the relevant settings

This information is [not sensitive](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57306964/are-azure-active-directorys-tenantid-and-clientid-considered-secrets) and can be emailed directly to the Pozi support team at support@pozi.com.

In addition to the information above, if you have not done so already, provide the Azure AD credentials (email address and password) of the [Pozi Support](prerequisites.md#support-account) user account. Please get in touch with us on how to securely provide us with these details.

<!-- ### App Roles

:::note Under Construction

*This section is a work in progress. Please get in touch with us before following any of the steps below*

:::

It is possible to assign app roles to users and groups and make those roles available through our token-based authentication/authorisation (which is currently still experimental).

The instructions below follow the [Microsoft guide on adding app roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps).

#### Create App Roles

* Go to the App Proxy application in the `App registrations` sections and select `App roles`
* Create the following app role for read access to Pozi Server:
  - Display name: `Pozi Server Read Access`
  - Allowed member types: `Users/Groups`
  - Value: `PoziServer.Read`
  - Description: `Read access to Pozi Server`
  - Do you want to enable this app role?: `✔`
* Create the following app role for write access to Pozi Server:
  - Display name: `Pozi Server Write Access`
  - Allowed member types: `Users/Groups`
  - Value: `PoziServer.Write`
  - Description: `Write access to Pozi Server`
  - Do you want to enable this app role?: `✔`

#### Assign App Roles to Users/Groups

* Go to the App Proxy application in the `Enterprise applications` section and in the `Manage` category, select `Users and groups`
* Select all users/groups that should get read access to Pozi Server and click on `Edit` in the top of the page
* Click on `Select a role` and select the role `Pozi Server Read Access` and click on `Select` in the bottom of the page
* For enabling write access follow the same steps again but now select the role `Pozi Server Write Access`
* Currently, the Azure UI shows one row per role per user/group. That is expected behaviour.

#### App Roles in Tokens

* The roles defined above will automatically become available in the authentication tokens in the browser, allowing Pozi to change its behaviour depending on the roles that the user (or the group they are in) have. -->
