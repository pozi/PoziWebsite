# Configuring Searches

Pozi's Search Panel offers users several options for searching for features and locations on the map.

- Preconfigured searches
- Generic searches
- Custom searches

## Preconfigured Searches

Your Pozi site may include one or more preconfigured searches that were included in your site's intial installation. These typically include Address and other search services provided by external providers. If you require any changes to these searches, please contact your Pozi reseller's helpdesk.

## Generic Searches

Any layer that is enabled for WFS, and is queryable, and is not configured to be hidden in the layer panel is automatically available as a search option. These search items are listed in the Search drop-down list under 'All searchable layers'. There is no special configuration required to enable these search options.

Users can type in text to match *any* field in the layer. Alternatively, users can click the Advanced button to access Pozi's table view for further search and filter options.

## Custom Searches

!!! Note

Datasets that are enabled for WFS (and aren't hidden in the layer panel) are automatically available as a generic search (see above). Before attempting to configure a layer as a custom search, check that the layer isn't already searchable via a generic search.

!!!

Large datasets such as a Property layer may be unavailable as a generic search because they are often configured for What's Here and hidden from the layer panel, which prevents Pozi from presenting the layer as a search option.

Layers that aren't available as a *generic* search can be configured to be available as a *custom* search.

Prerequisites:

* The layer must be enabled for WFS
* The layer must be hidden in the layer panel

Using keywords, you can configure any of the layer's fields to be searchable. Each field you specify will show up as a separate search item in the drop-down list.

### Example

In this example, we'll use the existing Property layer which is already configured to show in the What's Here results and be hidden in the layer panel. We'll append the `searchFields` keyword to enable the Property layer to be searchable by the `polygon_nu`, `land_id` and `pi_parcel` fields, separated by semicolons.

Layer > Properties > QGIS Server > Keyword list:

```
parent=Whats Here, showInLayerControl=false, searchFields=polygon_nu;land_id;pi_parcel
```

This configuration will expose the `polygon_nu`, `land_id` and `pi_parcel` fields as search options. If the fields are configured in QGIS with a user-friendly [alias](./configuring-layers/#rename-fields), Pozi will use the alias when showing the search item in the drop-down list.
