## Options

### Redirect

If this parameter is added, the current page will be redirected to the Pozi map zoomed to the address.

`redirect=true`

### New Tab

If this parameter is added, the Pozi map will be loaded in a new tab zoomed to the address. Note this option can have issues with browser security such as the built in popup blockers, in particular in IE and Firefox. Whilst the user can change the settings in their browser to allow popups, depending on the expected customer, it may be more appropriate to avoid using the Newtab parameter and live with the downside of having the Pozi map load in the same tab as the address search was performed.

`newtab=true`
