# Pozi Publisher

Pozi Publisher standardises a wide range of spatial information from inside and outside your organisation into easily digestible ***map catalogues*** that integrate seamlessly into Pozi Web GIS.

## Working with Catalogues

A ***map catalogue*** is a collection of map layers, typically in XML format generated by a WFS or WMS `GetCapabilities`, or a QGIS `GetProjectSettings` service call.

The catalogue is the unit around which the Pozi Publisher workflow is based, either generating catalogues from various sources, modifying catalogues for specific use cases, or extracting information from catalogues.

## Installation

### Install Pozi Publisher

1. Create folder `C:\Pozi\Publisher`
2. Obtain Publisher from Pozi Support, and extract to/past  e to the new folder

### Installing AWS Tools for Powershell

+++ Run Powershell as Administrator

1. Type `Install-Module -Name AWS.Tools.Installer`
2. Answer 'Y' to the various security prompts

+++ Alternative installation

1. Download [AWS Tools](https://sdk-for-net.amazonwebservices.com/ps/v4/latest/AWS.Tools.zip).
2. Type `$Env:PSModulePath` on a PowerShell command line. This will provide a list of possible folders that the module zip file can be extracted in. It needs to be one that the application can access when running as a task or service.
3. Extract the zip file into the chosen folder.

+++

### Install AWS Tools Modules

- Extra modules are required for authentication and using S3 buckets.
- Type `Install-AWSToolsModule AWS.Tools.EC2,AWS.Tools.S3 -CleanUp`

## Configuration

| Section | Key | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **`[Input]`** | `folder` | QGIS project folder | `folder=C:\Pozi\Projects`
| | `file` | QGIS project file | `file=C:\Pozi\Projects\Assets.qgs`
| | ??? | QGIS GetProjectSettings URL | ???`=http://localhost/pozi/qgisserver?MAP=C:/Pozi/Projects/Assets.qgs&SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetProjectSettings` |
| | `wfs` | WFS URL | `wfs=https://data.gov.au/geoserver/wfs?SERVICE=WFS&REQUEST=GetCapabilities` |
| | `wms` | WMS URL | `wms=https://iws.maps.vic.gov.au/erdas-iws/ogc/wms/RDP?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetCapabilities` |
| **`[Output]`** | `folder` | Destination folder for catalogue XML files | `folder=C:\Pozi\Cache` |
| | `name` | Name of destination XML file | `name=deeca-iws-wms-southerngrampians` |
| | `dataFolder` | Destination folder for GeoJSON and SLD files | `dataFolder=C:\Pozi\Cache` |
| | `backupFolder` | Destination folder for creating time-stamped backup QGIS files, to enable version control. | `dataFolder=C:\Pozi\Backup` |
| | `searchFolder` | Destination for SearchDB file | `searchFolder=C:\Pozi\Search` |
| | `order` | Comma-delimited list of layers in the order they should be presented in the output file. Regular expressions are recognised, so asterisks (*) should be used if the full name isn't going to be specified. Once the layers in the list have been processed, any remaining layers will be kept in their original order. **Note:** This uses layer names after `Replace` statements have been completed. | `order=*Centre,Kindergartens,Maternal Child Health Centres,Playgrounds,*Court*` |
| **`[QGIS_Server]`** | `url` | If the `source` is a QGIS project file or folder of files (as opposed to a URL), specify the URL of the QGIS Server which is needed to serve the required `GetProjectSettings` responses. | `url=http://localhost/pozi/qgisserver` |
| **`[Filters]`** | `exclude` | Comma-delimited list of layers to exclude from the output. Will exclude any layer that has a `title` which contains this text. | `exclude=meeting-rooms,soccer` |
| | `include` | Comma-delimited list of layers to include in the output. Will include any layer that has a `title` which contains this text. **Note:** `Include` statements are processed after `exclude` statements. | `include=wimmera-grampians_2020dec20_air_vis_15cm_mga54` |
| **`[Replace]`** | `{old text}={new text}` | Text in layer `title` to replace, and the replacement text. Regular expressions can be used in these statements to improve flexibility and accuracy of string replacements. For more information on regular expression, please see [Microsoft's Powershell Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_regular_expressions?view=powershell-5.1). | `wimmera-grampians_2020dec20_air_vis_15cm_mga54.ecw=Aerial Photo Dec 2020` |
| **`[AWS]`** | `bucket` | Destination AWS S3 bucket | `bucket=connect.pozi.com/userdata/gleneira-publisher` |
| | `key` | Key | `key={Add Key}` |
| | `secret` | Secret | `secret={Add Secret}` |

## Examples

### Generate map catalogues from QGIS projects

Generate production-ready OGC-compliant map catalogues from QGIS projects.

- Improve load times in web map applications by pre-generating catalogues from internal and external web map servers into static XML files
- Version control of QGIS projects

==- Example

```ini
[Input]
folder=\\cscgisweb02\d$\Pozi

[Output]
folder=C:\Pozi\Cache

[QGIS_Server]
url=http://localhost/pozi/qgisserver

```

==-

### Generate map catalogues from external sources

Save local versions of catalogues from external providers.


### Customise catalogues

Generate custom catalogues from external web servers.

- Search and replace text
- Filter layers
- Embed custom metadata

### Bulk data generation/extraction

Export GeoJSON and SLD files for all layers in a catalogue.

- Bulk download map data from external catalogues on a routine schedule

### Sync to cloud

Sync data generated from local sources up to S3.

- Publish layers to the public from QGIS projects 

### Build search indexes

Compile index of features and attributes for fast searching.

- Search index generator

## Running Publisher

### In Powershell

1. Open Powershell
2. Navigate to the Pozi Publisher folder `cd C:\Pozi\Publisher`
3. Run Pozi Publisher adding the `ini` settings file as a parameter. `.\src\PoziPublisher.ps1 "C:\Pozi\Publisher\deeca-iws-wms-northerngrampians-lga.ini"`

### As a scheduled task

1. Open `Task Scheduler` in Windows.
1. Create a new scheduled task
1. In most cases these tasks will need to be `Run whether user is logged in or not`, possibly with an administrator login, to ensure it can be run at any time.
1. Under `Triggers` set up the frequency the task should be run.
1. In the `Actions` tab, create a new action.
    1. The action should be `Start a program`.
    1. In the `Program/script` dialog box type `powershell.exe`.
    1. For the `Add arguments (optional)` dialog box, add the location of Pozi Publisher and the `.ini` setting file, as follows: `-File "C:\Pozi\PoziPublisher\src\PoziPublisher.ps1" -iniFiles "C:\Pozi\Publisher\deeca-iws-wms-northerngrampians-lga.ini"`
1. Customise any further settings in the scheduled task.
