# Open Office

When users select one property (with a standard click) or multiple properties (using `Ctrl+click` or the polygon selection tool), Pozi displays a button called "Send to Open Office".

When clicked, the Open Office application is launched and the selected property numbers read by the Open Office API for its specialised workflows.
