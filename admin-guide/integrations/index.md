If there's an application you need to integrate with, and you don't see it here, talk to us! We'll give you an idea of how easy it will be to integrate.

## Cloud Applications

Pozi’s simplest form of integration with other cloud apps is through dynamic links.

If your cloud application enables users to launch a session using a URL such as `example.com/?property=12345`, then Pozi can generate a link on-the-fly for any feature that a user clicks on from the map.

[!ref CouncilWise Example](./councilwise)

Pozi similarly enables linking in the other direction, ie, from your cloud application into Pozi via a similar dynamic URL that uses a property id.

For example: https://westwimmera.pozi.com/?propnum=1018753

Pozi also supports other forms of integration based on what the cloud application’s API supports.

Talk to us about your aims for integrating Pozi with your other cloud applications.
