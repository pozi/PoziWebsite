# Google Maps Platform

## Google Basemap

Google Maps offers high-quality basemap with a crisp design and comprehensive content. As the world's most popular basemap, users will feel right at home with Google Maps as a background map on which to view your orgnanisation's layers. If you're organisation has a Google Maps API key, you can use the Google Basemap in Pozi.

## Google Street View

Google Street View is included by default in Pozi. You don't need to have your own Google Maps API key to use it.
