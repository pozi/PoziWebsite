Some operations on MapInfo tables are not supported with the latest/default version of GDAL. See https://github.com/gisinternals/buildsystem/issues/187.

In the meantime, download https://connect.pozi.com/vendor/release-1900-gdal-3-2-1-mapserver-7-6-2.zip and extract to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Pozi\server\vendor\gdal-3-2-1`.

Update any affected `.setenv.bat` files accordingly.
